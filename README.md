# Prospective website for sebsilbernagl.me

This is a website built with Next.js with the goal of using the static export shipped with NextJS.

To see a completed static exported site, visit sebsilbernagl.me

### Roadmap

Eventually, I would like to take all content on the site to a headless CMS (Contentful or NetlifyCMS), hence the intended designed modularity of the components. 

### This is a working directory, so things change without warning. 

To install, the latest version of Node & npm is needed.

```
git clone https://github.com/sebsilbernagl/next-website.git
cd next-website
npm install
npm run dev
```
